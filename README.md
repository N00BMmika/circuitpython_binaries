# Circuitpython Binaries
This repository holds CircuitPython firmware and library versions which are in use of my other github projects. Having binaries in this repository makes it easier to find right binary versions. 
Each MCU board and version is in it's own branch.

Latest binaries can be found from https://circuitpython.org/
